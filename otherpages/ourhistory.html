                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                        content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
                        is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
                        content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
                        and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search 
                        for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various 
                        versions have evolved over the years, 
                        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                        We have been committed to environmentally friendly agriculture from 2014.
                        We have 45 ha of cashew nuts farm called “SCY (Sambor Community of Youth)”, which is located near Sambor Prei Kuk, registered as World Heritage in 2017.
                         We don’t use any pesticides nor chemical fertilizer, but we take care of cashew nuts in ecological ways, in order that we keep natural life for the future. Students in Phum Asia and SCY practices the ecological way and learn how to proceed to final products.
                        Phum Asia believes in environmentally friendly cultivation of food to ensure a sustainable future.
